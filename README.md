# GitterGraph

GitterGraph is a terminal user interface (TUI) application for visualizing git commit graphs. Built with the [Textual](https://www.textualize.io/) framework and [pygit2](https://www.pygit2.org/), it provides an interactive and intuitive way to explore your repository's history directly from the command line.
